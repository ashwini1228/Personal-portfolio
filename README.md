This project is a modern, responsive personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and external libraries such as Font Awesome and Google Fonts. It is designed to showcase an individual’s professional profile, skills, services, past projects, and contact information. The portfolio follows a clean and visually engaging layout, making it suitable for developers, designers, freelancers, or anyone looking to present their work and expertise online.

The website begins with a full-screen landing section that introduces the portfolio owner. This section includes a professional greeting, a job title, and a personalized introduction. A navigation bar at the top allows users to easily jump to key sections of the site: Home, About, Services, Portfolio, and Contact. The design is responsive and ensures a consistent experience across devices.

The "About" section provides a detailed personal introduction, highlighting the individual’s passion for front-end development, technical strengths, and approach to web design. It includes an image alongside text and a tabbed layout to showcase Skills, Experience, and Education. This interactive section is powered by JavaScript, allowing users to switch between tabs without reloading the page.

The "Services" section outlines the main professional offerings, such as Web Design, UI/UX Design, and App Design. Each service is presented in a card format with an icon, title, description, and link for more information. These cards feature hover effects that enhance interactivity and visual appeal.

The "Portfolio" section displays a grid of previous projects with images, titles, and short descriptions. When hovered over, each project reveals an overlay with additional information and an external link icon. This layout uses modern grid styling and transition effects to create an engaging visual experience.

In the "Contact" section, users can find contact information, including email and phone number, and links to social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter. There is also a functional contact form integrated with Google Apps Script that allows users to submit messages directly through the site. Submitted messages display a temporary confirmation and clear the form automatically, enhancing the user experience.

Styling across the site is managed through a custom CSS stylesheet. It uses a dark theme with accent colors (mainly pink and white), rounded buttons, smooth hover transitions, and a mobile-friendly grid system. The fonts are sourced from Google Fonts to maintain readability and consistency.

This personal portfolio website serves as a strong foundation for any professional looking to establish an online presence. It is easily customizable and extendable, making it ideal for beginners and intermediate developers working on personal branding or client portfolios. Features such as responsive design, modular sections, and clean code make it both practical and presentable.

In conclusion, this project combines clean code, modern design principles, and interactive features to deliver a polished personal portfolio website. It provides a platform to present skills, showcase projects, and make it easy for potential employers or clients to get in touch.
